								<p align = justify><p align = justify>
									Inherently, I am an enthusiastic advocate of technology, deeply driven to employ cutting-edge innovations in addressing practical, everyday problems. My overarching objective is to conceive and expand inventive solutions that enhance the quality of life. My proficiency lies in forming and guiding teams, swiftly embracing novel perspectives, and surmounting intricate hurdles to achieve this mission.</p>

									<p align = justify>I am currently pursuing a Master of Science in Computer Science at the University of Texas at Arlington. As a Graduate Research Assistant, I've been involved in cutting-edge research in the fields of Optimization and Machine Learning for Networks, contributing to groundbreaking advancements in graph neural networks. My role requires strong leadership, adaptability, and problem-solving skills, which I consistently apply.</p>
									<p align = justify>Based on my personal and professional experiences:</p>
									<ul>- I excel at leading projects and managing diverse teams.</ul>
									<ul>- Effective communication is one of my key strengths.</ul>
									<ul>- I have a strong inclination to make well-informed decisions based on data.</ul>
									<ul>- I am dedicated to continuous self-improvement, both personally and professionally.</ul>
									In my spare time, I cherish meeting new people and gaining fresh experiences. I'm an avid reader, movie enthusiast, and I'm constantly seeking ways to broaden my knowledge and refine my perspectives on various subjects. My passion for growth and learning is a driving force in both my personal and professional life.								</p>
								
								<h3>More details about me</h3>
								<p align = justify> I being a logical thinker, I had always found myself drawn to Science, Mathematics, and Computers. My affinity towards these subjects led me to win a gold medal in the International Mathematics Olympiad and National Science Olympiad. My first tryst with computers was in secondary school when studying the fundamentals of computers. For me, computers have always been a fascinating invention: a little device that works wonders. Writing every line of code snippet piqued my interest in learning more about this profession. However, the most intriguing aspect was that the computer profession included all three of my favourite disciplines, which prompted me to seek a Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering and also ignited my interest in artificial intelligence and machine learning. </p>
								<p align = justify>In college, I generally indulged myself in complex projects and research papers from within  and outside our coursework. I studied my subjects with deep interest and a thorough  understanding of the basic concepts governing them. This led to attaining good grades over  each of the past six semesters, and at the same time, I cleared the GATE test among the top 5%  students in India. However, I soon realized that to continue this perusal towards expertise  within the topics of my passion, I will certainly have to attempt higher learning, and the best  course available is to attempt a Master’s degree in Computer Science in the USA. During  interaction with my professors, it revealed that the work done so far presented would be an  ideal base, and this, combined with my academic pursuits and interests, will make me a  graduate student with knowledge and focus. I will certainly add a high level of motivation and  determination for success and a willingness to put in hard work.</p>
								<p align = justify>My project work has been focused on the use of one or more tools and technologies to achieve  specific results. At the state-level hackathon, I presented a project named "Universal Electronic  Medical Health Record AI-App" (Android-JAVA, Firebase, MySQL). The project is intended  to provide a paperless service to store records and with a pre-trained AI-model to detect  suspected diseases. Further, I undertook an SSIP-funded IoT project (Raspberry Pi), "E Attendance System using Machine Learning." I trained a facial recognition model using the  CNN-HOG hybrid approach and created a simple pipeline to train it on GPU-Server. A paper  on this was presented at the international conference and is projected to be published in a  Scopus-indexed journal. Next, I worked on "PlantConnect: Your Farm AI-Helper App." It is a  crop disease predictor developed using machine learning and android. The ResNet-50 Keras  model was trained using the 54305-image dataset, which was able to detect 26 diseases in 14  varieties of crops (Accuracy 97.57%). English to Hindi is difficult for many, so I created a  seq2seq model for language machine translation, which I trained using a custom dataset of  10,000 English-Hindi pairs. I also worked on "Sudoku Solver WebApp Using OpenCV", built  using Flask, Backtracking Algorithm, Image Processing, OpenCV, and Python. These were  some of many projects that significantly strengthened my base in software development using  artificial intelligence and machine learning.</p>
								<p align = justify>Besides projects, undertaking complex research has been a passion. This has led me to work  on numerous contemporary topics, including "Blockchain-based Software-Defined Vehicular  Networks for Intelligent Transportation System Beyond 5G"; "A Comprehensive Review on  Intelligent Traffic Management using Machine Learning Algorithms" (both accepted in  Springer); and "A Comprehensive Review on Crop Yield Prediction using ANN and CNN"  (projected to be published in Springer). These were identified by me as some of the emerging  technologies, which are very close to my interests and passion. I conducted an extensive library  search through various resources to arrive at an exhaustive database. I then proceeded to study  and analyze it, which later whetted with the inputs from industry professionals</p>
								<p align = justify>Working among professionals has been a passion that I have nurtured over time. This led me  to work at Skibb Tech PVT. Ltd., Ireland, where I, through remote interaction, worked on NLP  and AWS-based technologies for voice response data. My task was to develop a named-entity  relation model using spaCy/NLTK and to develop an audio-fingerprint matching mechanism.  I also worked as a market research analyst intern at PackBagBuddy to hone my skills in data  visualization and analysis using Tableau. Another rewarding experience was at Infomize  Technologies as a machine learning intern with the specific role of developing in computer  vision (MMDetection, detectron2) and working with Azure cloud services to make it scalable.  While these experiences were highly fulfilling and satisfying, they also made me aware of the  latest level of technology evolution and the direction and pace that it is going to follow in the  future. And though I was always highly motivated towards pursuing a graduate degree, these  experiences made my decision sacrosanct.</p>
								<p align = justify>To prepare me for the task, I have undertaken various independent coursework through perusal  of online courses such as Machine Leaning (Stanford-online), Deep Learning and TensorFlow  Developer Professional Certificate Specialization by deeplearnig.ai, and many more. Also  attended workshops on Data Science, Internet of Things and Django. It's an immense pleasure  to tell you that I am a state-level field hockey player, and a core-team member of various  student clubs and GTU Central Techfest’19. All these led to strengthening my leadership and  group skills, as I was involved in making executive decisions and building rapport.  </p>
